                <blockquote>
                  "Education can be divided into two kinds of knowledge: first is the academic knowledge, which will be beneficial to oneself and the country, if applied after completing the course of learning; second is moral knowledge, or 'Dhamma', that is, learning how to conduct oneself. Both require wisdom on the part of the learner. But those who use only the academic knowledge, without moral knowledge, cannot be considered persons of wisdom."
